# Simple card checker

## Task definition.
Task is to design and implement a Kotlin/Java framework which provides methods to perform this filtering. Assume that a credit card number is valid if:
* it contains only numbers and no leading 0
* it is 12-19 digits long
* it passes the Luhn check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm. For credit â€¨
card numbers, the Luhn check digit is the last digit of the sequence.
In addition, connect to https://binlist.net API and put additional information about credit card in response to user of your framework.
